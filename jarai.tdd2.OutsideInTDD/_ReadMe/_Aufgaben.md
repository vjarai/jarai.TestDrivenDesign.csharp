# Übung 2: Outside-In TDD

## In outside-in TDD we only implement what is needed to serve the outside.
- Write an acceptance test that fails
	- Something that can be accepted by a stakeholder			
	- The feature test
- Keep it red	
	- It will indicate what to test
	- Drive to the next step

- ***This double loop continues till the feature test turns green***
